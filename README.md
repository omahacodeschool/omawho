This project is a fairly standard Rails app: CRUD for a user, and a User belongs to a Category. It is a rebuild, from scratch, of http://omawho.com.

Each user's photo is shown on the homepage; you can filter by category.

Bonus feature: Some kind of quiz.

The biggest challenge here is building an attractive design for the site. I like the design for the site as it is now, but I don't love it. I want something cleaner, like these: http://www.awwwards.com/gallery/5654/30-grid-based-websites/, http://www.awwwards.com/gallery/5661/30-grid-based-websites/
